Requirements: This code was tested in Matlab2016b on Mac OS X (but
should run on other version)

1. Running Fig_hippLTP.m compares the model with the data from
hippocampal LTP (see the expected output in Fig_hippLTP_out.png and
Figure 2 in the paper):

2. Running statLTSP_gui.m displays a graphical interface that allows
the user to play with the different parameters of the model (it should
look like statLTSP_gui_out.png)

Data: All datasets are available on Mendeley Data (see paper for more
details) Note: You should be able to easily get the code you need and
translate it to other programming languages.
