<p>Requirements: This code was tested in Matlab2016b on Mac OS X (but should run on other version)

  <li>Running Fig_hippLTP.m compares the model with the data from hippocampal LTP (see the expected output in Fig_hippLTP_out.png and Figure 2 in the paper):<br/><br/>

  </li><li>Running statLTSP_gui.m displays a graphical interface that allows the user to play with the different parameters of the model (it should look like statLTSP_gui_out.png):<br/><br/>

<p>Data: All datasets are available on Mendeley Data (see paper for more details)
</p>
<p>Important note: In our framework we always work with q normalised (unitless). This is because when comparing with the data we scale q by the mean q in the data (see Methods). However, for the plots we map q back to mV to be easily comparable with observed values. In addition we assume an Euclidean metric (in contrast to a Riemannian metric for example) for the gradient descent, because this was sufficient to match experimental observations.
</p>
<p>Note 2: You should be able to easily get the code you need and translate it to other programming languages.</p>
